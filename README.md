# Online Catalog

This project uses the Flask, Python, and SQL to create an online catalog. Users can add, edit, and delete categories and items within each category.

## Getting Started

* Install Vagrant and VirtualBox
* Clone the fullstack-nanodegree-vm repository.
* Launch the Vagrant VM (by typing vagrant up in the directory fullstack/vagrant from the terminal).
* Write the Flask application locally in the /vagrant/catalog directory (which will automatically be synced to /vagrant/catalog within the VM).
* Run your application within the VM by typing python /vagrant/catalog/application.py into the Terminal. If you named the file from step 4 as something other than application.py, in the above command substitute in the file name on your computer.
* Access and test your application by visiting http://localhost:[enter local host port] locally on your browser.

## Prerequisites

* Vagrant Installation Files
* VirtualBox Installation files
